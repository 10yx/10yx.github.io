Last updated: November 25, 2025

## Privacy by Design

Counterr is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe a counter app should be simple, fast, and completely private.

## Data Collection: None

**Counterr collects zero data.** Everything you count stays on your device.

We do not:
- Collect any personal information
- Track your usage patterns
- Gather analytics
- Use advertising SDKs
- Create user accounts

## Data Storage: Local Only

Your counter state (count value, settings, increment value) is stored locally on your device using iOS UserDefaults. This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not transmitted to any servers
- Is not shared with any third parties
- Is automatically deleted if you uninstall the app

## Network Access: None

Counterr operates entirely offline and makes **no network requests** whatsoever. The app:
- Does not connect to the internet
- Does not communicate with external servers
- Does not share data with other apps or services

## Third-Party Services: None

Counterr does not integrate with any third-party services:
- No analytics platforms
- No crash reporting services
- No advertising networks
- No social media integrations

## Technical Details

For transparency, here's what iOS APIs Counterr uses:
- **UserDefaults**: Stores your counter data locally on your device
- **File Timestamp APIs**: Used by iOS system for standard app operations

These are documented in the app's Privacy Manifest (`PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`) submitted to Apple.

## Your Rights

Since we collect no data, there is no data to:
- Access
- Export
- Delete
- Correct

Your counter data exists only on your device and is under your complete control.

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change our privacy practices (which would require a fundamental redesign of the app), we will:
1. Update this policy
2. Update the App Store listing
3. Notify users through an app update
