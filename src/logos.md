Welcome to our Logos and Usage page. Here, we provide you with clear
guidelines on how to use our company logos in a proper and respectful
manner. It is important to follow these guidelines to maintain the
integrity and authenticity of our brand.

## Proper Usage Guidelines

1. You may use a permitted 10yx logo to link back to our platform. This
   is a great way to direct users to our website while maintaining the
   visual identity of our brand.

2. You may use the 10yx logo in a blog post or news article about us. We
   encourage you to share your experiences and thoughts about our
   company, and using our logo in these instances helps to create a
   visual connection between your content and our brand.

3. When using our logos, please ensure that they are displayed less
   prominently than your own company or product name or logo. Our logos
   should complement your content, but not overpower it. Maintain a
   balance that showcases both our brand and yours effectively.

## Usage Restrictions

To protect the integrity of our brand and avoid any misrepresentation,
please adhere to the following usage restrictions:

1. Do not use the 10yx name or any 10yx logo in a way that suggests you
   are 10yx, or that your offering or project is by 10yx, or that 10yx
   is endorsing you or your offering or project. It is important to
   maintain transparency and clearly differentiate your brand from ours.

2. Do not use any 10yx logo as the icon or logo for your
   business/organization, offering, project, domain name, social media
   account, or website. Our logos are unique to our brand and should not
   be used to represent any other entity.

3. Do not modify the permitted 10yx logos, including changing the color,
   dimensions, or combining with other words or design elements. Our
   logos are carefully designed to reflect our brand identity, and any
   alterations may compromise their integrity.

4. Do not use 10yx trademarks, logos, or artwork without prior written
   permission from 10yx. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property
   is strictly prohibited.

5. Do not use 10yx logo for your company or business or any other
   activity as if it is your own logo. Our logos are exclusive to our
   brand and should not be used to represent any other entity.

## Miscellaneous

Please note that our logos are not limited to those shown above. If you
require access to additional logo variations or need assistance with
logo usage, please contact us for further information.

## Legal

In summary, the 10yx logos represent only 10yx and should not be used to
represent you or your projects, products, or company without proper
authorization. We take the protection of our brand seriously and
appreciate your cooperation in adhering to these guidelines.

If you have any questions or require clarification regarding the usage
of our logos, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. Thank you for
your understanding and support in promoting our brand responsibly.
